On recomputation
----------------

I currently feel like constructing the recomputation graph should take
as starting point the original training graph.

Thougts today, having written most of the basic neuralnet code:
* need to insert long-range topo-cons.
* can match sub-graphs within sub-graphs. So match recompute paths, 
  and within these, match convs or whatever.
