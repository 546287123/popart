aka project checkpoint. 

skills needed:
-- pytorch training: how does it work exactly.

TODO: 
01/09/2018
-----------------------
(DONE) Tensor::consumers. How does this work for multiple consumers?

02/09/2018
-----------------------
start by documenting removeNullOp and all the functions it calls. 

03/09/2018
-----------------------
TensorInfo types:
  * TensorInfo::nbytes(). 
  * TensorInfo::append(),
  * how will the tensors get and set data? templates?

Rethink the step(int) function. 
Think about backend abstraction.
