What to do when the models from willow and pytorch don't match?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The names of tensors in the ONNX model exported from pytorch cannot
be matched to the tensors in the forward() function of the pytorch Module.

If you need to see the numerical values of a tensor in the forward pass
of the pytorch module, consider, 
1) printing it directly in the forward() function
2) returning the tensor from the forward() function and printing later
3) ... some bettter solution, I'm no pytorch expert!

If you need to see the numerical values of a GRADIENT tensor, 
consider using hooks.
As an example, suppose we have this defined in the forward() function:

        probs = self.softmax(preprobs)

and we want to see the gradient of probs. Then use, 

        probs.register_hook(lambda x: print("gradient of probs"))
        probs.register_hook(print)
